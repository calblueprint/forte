            Most of our teachers are experienced non-professional musicians
            currently studying at undergraduate/graduate programs or working in
            the local community.  Forte offers teachers a rewarding opportunity
            to enrich the lives of underserved youth while leveraging their unique
            skill set.  Though many of our teachers are currently active in the
            music community outside of Forte, for some it provides an avenue to
            reconnect with their passion for music and share it with others.

            Our teachers may elect to provide lessons as either unpaid volunteers

            service hours with all lesson proceeds contributed to the Forte
            nonprofit and used to maintain and expand our programs.  Those
            choosing to teach as paid contractors retain 75%+ of all lesson
            proceeds, making our program an attractive and flexible opportunity
            to earn supplemental income while making a positive impact.

          We encourage all interested students to apply, but we prioritize acceptance

          To us, underserved students are those who lack the proper resources or
          funding to fully pursue their musical aspirations.  With public school
          budgets dramatically reduced in recent years, even traditionally
          affordable school music programs have inevitably declined in quality
          or, in some cases, been completely eliminated.  With traditional
          private instruction accessible to only a select few, we aim to bridge
          the gap for many students and their families by creating an affordable,
          high-quality alternative.
